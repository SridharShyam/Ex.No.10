## Aim:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques such as query decomposition, decision-making, answer engineering, semantic filtering, and tail generation can be employed to create structured business reports and case studies. The objective is to show how prompt design influences the quality, depth, and coherence of AI-generated content.

## Procedure

1. **Introduction to Prompt Patterns:**

   * Query Decomposition – breaking complex prompts into smaller parts.
   * Decision-Making – guiding the AI to select from options.
   * Answer Engineering – refining format and structure.
   * Fact Checklist – ensuring factual accuracy.
   * Tail Generation – extending analysis logically.
   * Menu Actions – providing multiple content directions.
   * Semantic Filtering – adjusting tone, style, and depth.

2. **Content Type Selection:**

   * Business Report on Market Trends
   * Case Study on Business Success

3. **Prompting Approach:**

   * Start with simple prompts to create a draft.
   * Refine prompts using decision-making, SWOT-based prompts, and structured formatting.
   * Evaluate and re-generate improved outputs.

4. **Evaluation Criteria:**

   * Coherence and flow of ideas
   * Professional tone and structure
   * Depth of insights (analytical content)
   * Originality and engagement

## Test Case Scenarios:

### **Scenario 1: Business Report on Market Trends**

**Prompt 1 (Basic):**
*“Write a short business report on current e-commerce market trends.”*

**Output:**
The e-commerce industry is growing due to rising smartphone use, digital payments, and improved logistics. Key trends include personalized shopping, AI-driven product recommendations, and increasing demand for sustainable packaging.

---

**Prompt 2 (Refined – Query Decomposition + Answer Engineering):**
*“Create a structured business report on global e-commerce market trends with sections: Introduction, Key Drivers, Challenges, and Future Outlook. Use professional tone.”*

**Output:**
**Business Report on Global E-commerce Trends**

* **Introduction:** The global e-commerce market is projected to exceed USD 8 trillion by 2030, driven by digital adoption worldwide.
* **Key Drivers:** Widespread smartphone usage, rapid digital payment adoption, AI-powered shopping experiences, and cross-border trade.
* **Challenges:** Cybersecurity risks, supply chain bottlenecks, growing competition, and data privacy regulations.
* **Future Outlook:** Augmented and virtual reality shopping, blockchain-based transactions, and sustainability-driven supply chains.

---

**Prompt 3 (Advanced – Decision-Making + Semantic Filtering):**
*“Analyze the future of e-commerce by comparing two possible directions: AI-driven personalization vs. sustainability-focused business models. Use a formal, analytical tone.”*

**Output:**
The future of e-commerce is shaped by two potential pathways:

1. **AI-Driven Personalization:** Companies will leverage predictive analytics, chatbots, and advanced recommendation systems to enhance customer loyalty and improve sales conversions.
2. **Sustainability-Focused Models:** Businesses will adopt eco-friendly logistics, recyclable packaging, and ethical sourcing to align with rising consumer values.

Market leaders will likely combine these approaches, balancing efficiency with responsibility to secure long-term growth.

### **Scenario 2: Case Study on Business Success (Tesla)**

**Prompt 1 (Basic):**
*“Write a case study on Tesla’s success.”*

**Output:**
Tesla’s success is largely attributed to its innovation in electric vehicles, brand image, and visionary leadership under Elon Musk. Its focus on performance, design, and sustainable energy positioned it as a pioneer in the EV market.

---

**Prompt 2 (Refined – SWOT-based Prompt):**
*“Develop a professional case study on Tesla’s business success using SWOT analysis. Include market positioning and innovation strategies.”*

**Output:**
**Case Study: Tesla’s Business Success**

* **Strengths:** First-mover advantage in EVs, strong brand equity, vertical integration of supply chains.
* **Weaknesses:** High production costs, limited mass-market models.
* **Opportunities:** Rising global EV demand, renewable energy ecosystem, expansion in Asian and European markets.
* **Threats:** Competitive pressure from traditional automakers, raw material shortages, and regulatory challenges.
  **Market Positioning:** Tesla positions itself as a premium, innovative, and sustainable brand.

---

**Prompt 3 (Advanced – Tail Generation + Semantic Filtering):**
*“Extend the Tesla case study by predicting its growth trajectory over the next decade, emphasizing innovation and global expansion. Use a formal report style.”*

**Output:**
Over the next decade, Tesla is expected to expand its global presence with affordable EV models targeting emerging markets. Advancements in battery technology and autonomous driving systems will strengthen its technological edge. Furthermore, Tesla’s investment in solar energy and storage solutions will support its transformation into a diversified sustainable energy company. By 2035, Tesla is projected to become a market leader not just in EVs, but in renewable energy integration worldwide.
